### Project 3: Linear Regression
The goal of the project is to understand the factors that determine the salaries and employment of engineers immediately after graduation. Factors such as grades at different levels/universities, candidates' skills, links between universities and industrial parks/technology companies, student qualifications and market conditions for specific industries will affect this. The dataset used in this project was collected in India and has been pre-processed.\
In this project, the above data has been performed the following pre-processing steps: 
1. Remove columns whose values are strings: 'DOB', '10board', '12board', 'Specialization', 'CollegeState' 
2. Remove columns related to identifiers and years: 'ID', 'CollegeID', 'CollegeCityID', '12graduation', 'GraduationYear'
Provided 2 files:
- 'train.csv': Contains 2248 samples used for model training 
- 'test.csv': Contains 750 samples used to test models
